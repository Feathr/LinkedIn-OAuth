This project is an amalagamation of two other projects - a LinkedIn client library and an OAuth consumer framework - with the goal of having an easy-to-use device- and simulator- compatible LinkedIn library.

Ideally, this would simply be a combination of two submodules, however there are class conflicts and the OAuth framework must be modified to include a property that the aging LinkedIn library expects.

Requirements:
 * libxml2 framework

Installation:
 1. git clone git@github.com:Feathr/LinkedIn-OAuth.git
 2. Add LinkedInClientLibrary and OAuthConsumer.framework to the XCode project
 3. Under Build Phases > Compile sources, add the "-fno-objc-arc" compiler flag to all of the LinkedIn library files
 4. Add libxml2.dylib & OAuthConsumer.framework to Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries
 5. Add "$(SDKROOT)/usr/include/libxml2" to the Header Search Paths in Build Settings

Sources:
 * LinkedIn library: https://github.com/ResultsDirect/LinkedIn-iPhone
 * OAuth Framework: https://github.com/JoseExposito/oauthconsumer (modified to add a property that the LinkedIn library expects)
